## The work stuff

I'm a Senior iOS Developer at [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/) doing some cool iOS stuff. I'm used to working in fast-paced environments and collaborating with interdisciplinary teams like Design, Testing, Platform and Analytics. Previously, I worked at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/in/) and [NEC Corp India](https://in.nec.com) as a Software Engineer too.

Currently, I have 7+ years of experience in iOS development, and a curiosity for backend development in Java.

## The rest

I studied CS at [Harcourt Butler Technological University (HBTU)](https://hbtu.ac.in). I speak a few languages including some programming ones. I make [apps on GitHub](https://github.com/31aditya-dev).

I play videogames in my free time, or maybe read books. Currently I am reading **Narnia - the LION, the WITCH and the WARDROBE by C.S.LEWIS**.
